# Angular 2 preview

This is just a little preview to taste angular 2. Discuss about it and see whether it is adapted for your next project

Bear in mind that some of the things we will see are probably going to change. So just keep the main concepts of the framework.

In this preview we will :

1. Setup a basic code structure to start an angular 2 app.
2. Build a traditional hello 'whoever'
3. Build a small Reddit like app (in much more simple)
